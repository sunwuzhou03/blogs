# Part 1: introduction

Absence of well-defined reqiurements $\rightarrow$ software project failure

# Part 2: Requirement V.S Specification

- requirement: a need of stakeholder and user that the software should address
- specification is a technical document with the analyzed requirements. A specification decribes the **features** and **behavior** of a software .
# System development cycle
- requirements
- analysis
- design
- code
- test
- depoly/immplement

steps 1, 2,3 ,5 are related to hci
# Two types of requirements
- functional
- non-functional

# Requirement Gathering and Analysis

- functional 
	- sepcification of system's functionality
	- actions that the system must take
	- not a quality
	- take care to be precise & unambiguous
- non-functional
	- look and feel
	- usability
	- performance
	- operational
	- security
# How do you write the requirement?

- Question 1: 
- Question 2: what methods will be used (or not ) to ascertain the answer to the above question?
	- ethnography
	- interviews
	- focus groups
	- user logging
	- questionnaires
	- technology tour
	- task analysis
	- end-user profiling
	- pact analysis (people, activity, context, technology)
	- cultural collection
	- activity theory

# Usability Specifications

Usability specfication (or UI Specs) are blueprint and template for designing interfaces.
