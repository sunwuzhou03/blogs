# Ergonomics, the definition

Ergnomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of the interactions among human and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance

# Ergonomics, refinement of definition

**please remember from previous classes:**
- system means both human and technique system
- performance is determinted by effectiveness, effciency, effort
- efficiency is a trade-off between speed and accuracy
- 'optimal' accordding to human judgement 

# Ergonomic, origin
- Governmental
	- Military
	- Fitts' law relates to efficiency of system performance
	- space exploration
- Industry and workplace
	- focus is on safety and productivity
- Diasters leading to lawsuits and public question

# Ergonomics: physical and cognitive
- physical
	- who are the user?
	- how does the technology fit?
	- how safe is the technology?
	- how do user interact with technology?
- cognitive
	- how do user expect the technology to work?
	- how is information displayed?
	- how well are stereotypical expecatations met?
	- how complex is the interface?
	- how much training is required?
	- what user knowledge assumptions are met?
	- how does information facilitate learning and memory?

# Physical Ergnomics

physical ergnomics is concerned with human anatomy, anthropometry (the measurement of human aspects), physiology and bio mechnical characteristics as they relate to physical activity in work or daily life

Working with the neck or back bent forward more than 30 degree for more than two hours per day causes injuries

- **Musculo-skeletal disorders**: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
- **Awkward postures**, including wrist bent in flexion 30 degree or more, or in extension 45 degree or more, or in ulnar deviation 30 degree or more
- Tendonitis **Risk Factors** of awkward/sustained postures
	- Repetition
	- Forceful exertion
	- Mechanical stress

How about gaming? Repetitive Strain Injury

# Cognitive Ergnomics

- Nuclear power plant, space travel, aviation: What are similarities cognitively?
	- Complex interface: memory overload 
	- Life-threatening circumstances (dealing with external factors)
	- Exceptionally focused attention is required
	- Risk managment during decision making

# In sum: How HCI design is indebted to Ergnomics

- User orientation
- Diversity
- Effect on humans
- Measurement
- Scientific Method
- Systems

# Input devices
- Ergonomics keyboards
	- no medical evidence that they reduce repetitve strain injuries..as they work for some, but not for others
- Pointing devices
	- advantage trackball over mice: stationary, uses less space, no need to move it around, works on any type of surface, including your knee. Who outdid trackball? touchpad
	- degree of freedom
	- joysticks
	- drone
	- cognitive ergonomics can be a probelm, owing to 'translation' of representation into action + left and right hands differs
- Touch screens
- Speech recognition (NLP)
- Monitoring devices
- Dialog techniques
- Eyetracker
	- heatmap
	- scanpath
	- no greate for tracking small target or where fine control is required
- headtracker
	- this type of device can be used by severely impaired users
- Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
	- no suited for tracking over samll targets or fine control
	- mind control through concentration of attention
	- emotion interpretation is nonsense (too context dependent)
- Breakout: Affective computing
	- Kuleshov Effect
		- Same face, Same expression, different context. What does that grin mean?


I/O devices from the 'user' interface 

# Output devices
- Visual
	- chracter-based display
		- LCDs, FPD...
	- graphics displays
	- printing device
	- microfiche, micro-film, videotap
	- 3-D printing
- Haptic (tactile)
	- force feedback
		- force feedback data gloves to pratice with virtual tools
	- textural feedback (vibro-tatile, electro-tactile, ultrasound)
	- thermal feedback
	- Sensory/perceptual illusions
		- rubber hand illusion
			- body transfer illusion
				- the illusion of owning either a part of a body or an entire body other than one's own
				- Embodiment
					- sense of self-location
					- sense of agency
					- sense of body ownership
		- haptic retargeting (use a single physical object to create the illusion of touching multiple virtual objects)
		- haptic proxy
			- sparse haptic proxy: A saucer that makes the user feel s/he touches buttons projected on a visor
			- Fitts' Law active in virtual environments
		- **slide not:** So apart optical illusion such as depth perception through motion parallax, optic flow, and slanted lines, we also anticipate to feel something when we see it is about to touch us(the brain fills in the associated feeling already)
	- Haptice resolution
		- Different haptic devices can render haptic in different resolutions
		- different body area have different spatial and temporal resolving capacity of haptics
	- Haptic make for accessible technology
		- virtouch mouse
			- the exploration is local. Hard to imagine 'the big picture' through the mouse

- Sound
	- Auditory Interpretation
		- detection
		- attention
		- localization
		- relative discrimination
		- identification
		- recognition
	- Auditory design
		- Compatibility
		- Approximation
		- parsimony
		- Avoid extremes
		- Do not overload the auditory system
		- Environment
		- Design trade-off
			- invariance
			- use interrupted or variable signal
- Spatial audio
	- acoustic attenuation
		- owl ears are assymmetrical for greater precison
	- occlusion
	- reflection
	- for your perual

# Advance I/O devices
- the trend
	- blending input and output
	- more intutive and natural interactions
		- multimodel interaction

- brain-to-brain communication
- agency-centered design
	- Deliverance of a function is important, whether done by  a human being or a machine is not
	- social robots will become the universal interface between humans and data analytics in the IoT

# Conclusion


# Summary

- HCI largely developed from Ergonomics (Human Factors) because it is concerned with human performance and well-being in working with (computing) machinery
- I/O devices, from a simple mouse to advanced VR goggles and gloves, directly concern Ergonomics because they are the interface to the computational system. If they don't work, your system runs down
- Ergonomics is mainly known for its physical aspects, e.g. , preventing mouse arms. A disater coming from lack of physical ergonomics was the 'big finger' incident at the Tokyo stock exchange 
- Cognitive ergonomics focus on memory load (data overflow), attention, ambiguity, or the effects of warnings, a disater coming from a lack of congnitive ergonomics was the crash of the American Airlines Flight 965
- I/O devices may tend to all sensory channels humans have (visual,haptic,even smell) . for a device to be ergonomically functional, you have to study the human physiological, perceptual, and information processing systems. Otherwise, you don't konw how it works and make design errors
- when choose I/O devices, be aware of the following steps
	- A device should match physiological /pyschological characteristics of users, their training , and their expertise. older adults may be hampered witharthritis, and may be unable to type; inexperienced user may be unfamiliar with BCIS and VR treadmills, etc
	- Devices should be appropriate for tasks to be performed. a drawing task requires a device that allows continuous movement; selecting an opyion from a list requires a device that permits discrete movement, etc.
	- Devices should be suitable for the intended work and enviromen. E.g., speech input may be usefulwhen there is no keypad or keyboard, or when the eyes and hands are busy, but is unsuitable in noisy conditions such as business fair

# How to solve the Ergonomics risk factor

- spread repetitive work out during the day
- take stretch pauses
- rotate task with co-works if possible
- change hands or motions frequently
