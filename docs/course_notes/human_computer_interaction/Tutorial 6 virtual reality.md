# Human Experience

The key to define virtual reality in terms of huamn experience rather than technological hardware is concept of **presence**

Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the **design, evaluation** and **implementation** of **interactive** computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surroundding them.

# Uncanny Valley Effect 
- Hypothesis:
	- a person's response to humanlike robot would abrubtly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance

# Place ilusion and Plausibility iluusion

- Place illusion
	- being there
	- presence
	- tele-presence
	- the illusion of being in a place in spite of sure knowledge that you are not there
- Plausibility illusion
	- the illusion that what is apparently happening is really happening (even though you know for sure that it is not)
- three necessary conditions of psi
	- events occur in relation to you personally
	- the virtual world responds to you
	- overall credibility (in the context)
# Technology

I define a virtual reality experience as any which the user is effectively immersed in a responsive vitual world. This implies user dynamic control viewpoint

# Four technologies are crucial for VR

- the visual (and aural and haptic) displays that immerse the user in the virual world and that block out contradictory sensory impressions from the **real world**
- the graphics rendring system that generates at 20 to 30 frames per seconds, the **ever-changing** images
- the tracking system that continually reports the **position and orientation** of user's head and limbs
- the database construction and maintenance system for building and maintaininng detail and realistic of virtual world

# For auxiliary technologies are important but not nearly so crucial for VR

- **synthesized sound**, displayed to ears, including **directional sound and simulated sound fields**
- display of synthesized **forces and other haptic sensations** to the kinesthetic senses
- devices, such as tracked gloves with push buttons, by which user specifies **interactions with virtual objects**
- interaction techniques that **subsititue for real interactions** possible with the physical world

# What are the most significant difference between HMDs and CAVE-like systems in bringing "the feeling of presence" to their users?
- the concept of immersion 
- you can simulate CAVE in HMD
- but you cannot simulate HMD in CAVE

# Why VR?
- Human Cognition
- Human Emotion 
- Exemplary Applications

# How VR works (for human vision)
- Depth clues
	- binocular dispartity: can't be presented on a conventional 2D display
	- perspective 
	- size of known objects
	- detail
	- occlusion
	- light & shadows
	- relative motion
	- accommodation: this is the muscle tension needed to change the focal length of the eye lens in order to focus at a particular depth
	- convergence: this is the muscle tension required to rotate each eye so that ist is facing the focal point

# What can be presented on a convential 2D display?
- perspective
- size of known objects
- detail
- occlusion
- light & shadows
- relative motion
**All above are "automatically" achieved via the rendering pipline!**

# Computer Graphics (CG)
- Rendering Pipeline
- Ray Tracing

# General (rasterization) RP

- Application
- vertex program
- geometry program
- clipping rasterization
- fragment program
- framebuffer operations
- display
**from vertices to pixel**

# Rasterization vs RT

- Rasterization RP is well optimized
- model rasterization RP supports more realistic lighting
	- lightmaps
	- light probes
	- real-time global illumination
- RT simulates real physical of light
- RT denoising is again very costly

# What is a digital twin
- a digital twin is a virtual representation of object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to helpdecision making
- enables real-time rendering and interaction within the metaverse
