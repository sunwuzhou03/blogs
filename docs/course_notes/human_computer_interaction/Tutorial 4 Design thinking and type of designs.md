# Introduction
The creation of user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX) is of utmost importance in the field of human-computer interaction.
Interface designers work to improve the usability, accessibility, and general user happiness of software application, websites, and other interactive platforms by incorporating UI/UX desigin.

**UI design**: focuses on the visual, interactive elements of a product to create aesthetically pleasing interface.
**UX design**: focuses on creating a seamless and meaningful user experience by understanding user needs, conducting research, and designing intuitive interface.

# what is design thinking?

**define**: desgin thinking is a non-liner, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.

involving five steps:
- emphasize: research your users' needs
- define: state your users' needs and probelms
- ideate: challenge assumptions and create ideas
- prototype: start to create solutions
- test: try your solutions out

**note**: these stages are not always sequential, and teams often run them in parallel, out of order, and repeat them in an iterative fasion.
# Why do we need Design Thinking?

design thinking is highly valuable in context of hci, ui/ux design , and interface design because it provide a structured and user-centric approach to problem-solving and innovation.


# Type of design

- **Good Desigin**: a design of interface is generally considered to be good when it is **innovative, simple, usable, learnable, understandable, and has a wow factor**
- **Poor desgin**: A design of any product or an interface is generally consider to be poor when a design is **difficult to use, not easy yo understand its functionally,and not interactive enough to understand its current state**
